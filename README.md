# Python State Machine Framework

A simple generative state machine framework. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Running the program
To run an the example, `PYTHONPATH=. python3 examples/VideoPlayer/VideoPlayer.py` in root.
 

### Example 

To use, run `VideoPlayer.py`.

In our example, the state machine is a video player. 
To issue a command, type one of the following:

ON_SIG
OFF_SIG
INSERT_SIG
PLAY_SIG
PAUSE_SIG
STOP_SIG
REWIND_SIG
FORWARD_SIG

You can use our state diagram to show expected behavior. When you run Automata.py, it will generate a small report of the objects created.
